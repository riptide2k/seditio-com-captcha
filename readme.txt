Features :

With this plugin, you can protect the comments for guests with a CAPTCHA. If a guest wants to submit a comment, he has to read the letters from the image and enter them for verification. This prevents spamming with bots.

CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing-Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart.

Installation :

1 : Unpack and upload the files into the folder : /plugins/comcaptcha/

2 : Go into the administration panel, then tab "Plugins", click the name of the new plugin, and at bottom of the plugin properties, select "Install all".

Notes :

Caution: Seditio isen't really designed to let guests post comments! You have to unlock it with the SQL query shipped in the package (mysql.txt). This could cause some unknown sideeffects, so keep in mind, that you do it on your own risk! However it worked in my test envoirenment..
